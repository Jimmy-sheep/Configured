# Catalogue

Catalogue for Fabric is a port of the original mod but has been modified and adapted specifically for Fabric. Catalogue provides a menu that can be accessed from the main menu or in-game that displays a list of all mods installed. The new menu makes it easier to search installed mods, submit bugs and see relevant mod information. Catalogue features a non-intrusive API for developers to open a configuration screen for their mod or even provide them for other mods. See the developers docs to see how you can easily support Catalogue!

ðŸ”§ If want to add support for Mod Menu's config entrypoint, install [Menulogue](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/menulogue)

## Developers

Catalogue uses the icon definined in your `fabric.mod.json` as the icon shown next to your mod in the list, which means your mod is likely already supported. However Catalogue has a few extended options if you would like to further customise the branding for your mod and specify a config screen. Catalogue uses a *non-intrusive API*, which means you do not even need to include it in your workspace or even depend on the mod. To learn more about the features of the API, see the [developer help page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/catalogue-fabric/pages/developer-wiki).
